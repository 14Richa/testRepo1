#### Reflections on My GSoC 2023 Journey: Accomplishments, Challenges, and What's Ahead


#####  Project Overview: Automate paperwork around project governance

The goal of my project was to automate the processes around project governance. This project aimed to automate the maintenance of the Maintainers.yaml file, which contained the list of maintainers and TSC members of AsyncAPI. The tasks involved implementing workflows to automatically update the member's list based on changes in other files, inviting new maintainers and TSC members, updating the Emeritus.yaml file when someone was removed, and aggregating helpful information in the Maintainers.yaml file. These automation and improvements made it easier to manage the maintainers and TSC members of AsyncAPI.
