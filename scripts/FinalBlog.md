#### Reflections on My GSoC 2023 Journey: Accomplishments, Challenges, and What's Ahead


In this blog post, I want to share what I did during Google Summer of Code 2023 with the amazing AsyncAPI Initiative.

During this program, I had the privilege of working with some amazing people who really helped me. I want to give a big shoutout to Lukasz Gornicki, Khuda dad Nomani, and Saurav Kumar for being great mentors. They guided me, supported me, and kept me motivated throughout the program.

Being a part of the AsyncAPI community has been a fantastic learning experience for me. I've gained so much knowledge, and working with this awesome group of people has been a truly memorable experience. In the upcoming sections of this blog post, I'll share the specific projects and achievements that made my Google Summer of Code 2023 journey so special.

#####  Project Overview: Automate paperwork around project governance

The goal of my project was to automate the processes around project governance. This project aimed to automate the maintenance of the Maintainers.yaml file, which contained the list of maintainers and TSC members of AsyncAPI. The tasks involved implementing workflows to automatically update the member's list based on changes in other files, inviting new maintainers and TSC members, updating the Emeritus.yaml file when someone was removed, and aggregating helpful information in the Maintainers.yaml file. These automation and improvements made it easier to manage the maintainers and TSC members of AsyncAPI.

##### Project Layout and Workflows

Before we get into the details of what I achieved, let's start with a visual overview of our project structure and workflows. You can see the full project layout and workflows in this GitHub issue: https://github.com/asyncapi/community/issues/810

This issue contains easy-to-understand diagrams that show how our project is set up and how various tasks are automated. It's like a map that helps us understand how different parts of our project work together.

Now, let's move on to the specific things I accomplished and contributed to during Google Summer of Code 2023 with the AsyncAPI Initiative.
